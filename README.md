# coinFlipExperiment

This is a simple experiment designed for project one of my Applied Statistics course, Fall 2017.

Many times published experiments are not repeated due to various reasons (ie. limited resources, not as distinguished as original results, etc.). In addition, the experiments that are published in peer-reviewed journals are sometimes biased by the researcher's need for "significant results" instead of those that agree with natural law or known experiments which are usually considered "boring" or "uninteresting" and are subject to the file-drawer effect. This creates a problem of having too many remarkable studies published with non-realistic outcomes.

We've created a simple experiment to observe the variability of a single sample experiment versus multiple samples to highlight the importance of test reproduction in scientific experimentation. The experiment will be to flip a fair coin 20 times and count the number of times it lands on heads, X ~ Binomial(20, 0.5). At such a low number of observations we would expect to see a good amount of variability from the mean value of 10. Each team member will individually repeat the experiment independently and then we will compare our individual results with that of the overall team outcome.
